**Reflection 21/05/2023**

I feel more comfortable with structuring HTML layouts now. However, my intuition in positioning with CSS is still weak in that I often find myself haphazarding adding and removing properties and values through trial-and-error, and then constantly toggling back to the browser to see the result. After some time of this, I lost patience and resorted to brute-forcing the CSS together so as to complete the project then and there. Thus, resulting in a messy HTML and CSS files that will likely need to be rewritten.

Also tried my hand in media queries in this project, quickly hacking together something that looks off, but not broken when the screen width falls below 900px.

On to the next topic, let's go!.
